2. **Missing Test Coverage** - No validation or integration tests
3. **ADK Integration Gap** - Mock ADK classes used instead of real integration
4. **Security Implementation** - Access control patterns defined but not enforced

### Medium Priority:

2. **Sample Data** - No example crisis cases or templates
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - No automated testing or deployment

### Low Priority:
1. **Documentation** - API documentation and deployment guides
2. **Performance Tuning** - Fine-tuning cache and connection parameters
3. **Monitoring Dashboards** - Grafana/monitoring UI setup

## **ESTIMATED COMPLETION**

- **Current Progress**: ~65% complete
- **Remaining Core Features**: Classification Agent, Recommendation Agent, ADK Integration
- **Remaining Infrastructure**: Docker, Tests, CI/CD, Sample Data
- **Estimated Additional Development Time**: 2-3 weeks for full completion

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

1. Complete Classification Agent with 7 sub-agents
